UPF:
1.add_port_state (legacy):The add_supply_state command is a generalization of add_port_state; add_supply_state can be used to define named supply states for supply ports, supply nets, and supply set functions.
  The state name can be arbitrary. If a voltage is specified, the supply net state is FULL_ON and the voltage value is the specified value; otherwise if off is specified, the supply net state is OFF.
  The state value can be multi, splited by space.
2.create_supply_set:
  When -function is specified, func_name shall be one of the following: power, ground, nwell, pwell, deepnwell, and deeppwell. The -function option associates the specified func_name of this supply set with
  the specified supply_net_name. If the same func_name is associated with two different supply nets, it shall be an error if those supply nets are not the same. The supply_net_name may be a reference to a supply net
  in the descendant hierarchy of the current scope using a supply net handle.
3.Both create_supply_port and create_supply_net has -domain option.
  create_supply_net -reuse: Extend availability of a supply net previously defined for another domain for use in the extent of this domain.
  create_supply_set -update: Use -update if the set_name has already been defined.
4.power state name = supply set_name or power domain name


CLP:
1.If you didn’t change the default rule set, tool will automatically adjust the rule check. If the rule is not applicable for the current design, tool will not run it. 
2.CROSSING_OFF_TO_ON_ISO: Isolation cell fails OFF to ON check. ISO supply net is off too.
  CROSSING_OFF_TO_ON_LSH: Level shifter cell fails OFF to ON check. LS supply net is off too.
  CROSSING_OFF_TO_ON_NOLP: Invalid OFF to ON crossing. May miss ISO or LS.
  CROSSING_VOLTAGE_CONFLICT_NOLSH:Signal driver and receiver have incompatible voltages.
      a.Check both L->H an H->L.
  1801_LSH_NO_STRATEGY_LH_PATH_LSH:Level shifter strategy is not specified for low-to-high power or high-to-low ground state crossing, on a path that contains a level shifter cell.
  1801_LSH_NO_STRATEGY_HL_PATH_LSH:Level shifter strategy is not specified for high-to-low power or low-to-high ground state crossing, on a path that contains a level shifter cell.
  1801_LSH_NO_STRATEGY_LH/HL_PATH_NOLSH:Level shifter strategy is not specified for low-to-high power or high-to-low ground state crossing, on a path that does not contain any level shifter cell.
      a. Let high level signal through Always On domain, then connect it to OFF domain.
3.A supply net need connect to supply src and supply dst.
4.1801_SUPPLY_CSN_MISSING_FOR_MACRO: Macro cell supply pin does not have a connection specified explicitly in the power intent.
  connect_supply_net setting may be needed for these supply pins to drive the implementation and analysis.
  a.internal power: use current scope net.
  b.external power: use set_quivalent -nets, through pad.
5.Level Shifter no control signal, if OFF domain OFF, what LS will happend?
6.1801_SUPPLY_PG_PIN_CONFLICT:
  (Critical) Supply net connects to instance pin of different type (power versus ground). Tool will not run rule check if this happpend.
  PG_CONN_SUPPLY_PIN_CSN_CONFLICT：
   Instance supply pin connection conflicts with the power intent supply connection setting.
   Reported when a connect_supply_net is used in the power intent to connect a supply net to a port that has already been connected to a different, non-equivalent supply net. The existing connection could be
   either a connection in the design or a connection created by a later connect_supply_net command in the power intent. In this situation, the tool will obey the existing connection for analysis.
7.1801_PST_STATE_DROPPED_ROOT:
  example:add_power_state PD1 -state {ON_SAME -logic_expr {SSet1==ON10 && SSet2==ON10}} -state {ON_DIFF -logic_expr {SSet1==ON10 && SSet2==ON12}}
          add_power_state PD2 -state {ON_SAME -logic_expr {SSet1==ON10 && SSet2==ON10}}
  Rule 1801_PST_STATE_DROPPED_ROOT will be reported on state PD1.ON_DIFF, and another rule 1801_PST_STATE_DROPPED_ROOT_SUPPLY_SET_STATE will be reported on state SSet2.ON12.
  If add_power_state PD3 -state {ON_SAME -logic_expr {SSet1==ON10}}, report 1801_PST_STATE_DROPPED_ROOT too.
  Reported when any power state defined at the root level is inconsistent with every state of any other PST, supply set, and power domain. Every means power domain state should include all supply_set state.
  Such state will be ignored by the tool when analyzing consistent states for level shifter insertion or for any power state-related rule checks.
  When a dropped root level state is of a supply set object, it will be reported in another rule 1801_PST_STATE_DROPPED_ROOT_SUPPLY_SET_STATE with default severity warning.
  1801_PST_STATE_DROPPED_ROOT_SUPPLY_SET_STATE:
  supply_set.state not used. Final power state should include all supply set state.
8.1801_PST_STATE_EQUIV_SUPPLY_CONFLICT:
  Reports a supply signal when the same or equivalent signal is assigned an inconsistent supply state in the same power state defined by add_pst_state or add_power_state. 
  Connected supply signals in the same pst state should be at the same voltage. This will cause power state drop.
9.[1801_LINT_OPT_MISSING_REQUIRED] create_supply_net: Missing required option: Supply net '*' was not originally created with option '-domain', therefore it cannot be reused.
  Supply_net can't be created twice.
10.CROSSING_VOLTAGE_CONFLICT_NOLSH：
  Signal driver and receiver have incompatible voltages.Reports a cell-to-cell path segment (without any level shifter instance at this segment) such that the driver's related supply and the receiver's related 
  supply power (or ground) functions do not have the same single root supply driver, and in some globally consistent power state they can be ON at different voltages.
  related power state.
11.SUPPLY_SET_LP_CELL_PIN_UNKNOWN:
   Supply set for a logic pin of low power or macro cell cannot be determined.
   Indicates that the related supply set cannot be determined for a logic pin of leaf cell. The related supply set for a pin is determined either using related pg pins and physical supply connections (physical cells)
   or using explicit or implicit connections specified by power intent (logical cells). This rule is checked for low power cells and macro cells.
12.PG_CONN_NON_SOURCE_DRIVE_SUPPLY:
   Instance pin not defined as supply source is driving a supply net.
   Reported when an instance output or inout pin that is not defined as a supply source is driving a supply net.

Power Anlysis:
1.Voltage is very important, current depend on capacity. We specify supply voltage srouce max current. res = wire res + instance res. If we apply coltage as instance require, normally it's will not overload.But if
  wire res too high, the instance voltage will drop. For example, one reg not ff, instance res is ulimit, so current is too slow. But if it ff, instance res is slow, and current will bigger and through instance. But
  the voltage source is contant.

Others:
芯片里面的地由于PAD寄生，bonding寄生电容电感，地不是那么强，特别是对于数字域来说，你想想数字里面全是时钟信号翻来翻去，那么快的瞬态变化，地没法完全吸收这些高频变化，导致地电位上很多小毛刺，这些小毛刺如果通过地线耦合到频率相对较低、抗躁
较弱的模拟电路中会严重影响模拟电路的性能，所以数字地不干净，模拟电路要远离它，数字电源同理。
