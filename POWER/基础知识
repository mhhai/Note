  1801_LSH_NO_STRATEGY_HL_PATH_LSH:Level shifter strategy is not specified for high-to-low power or low-to-high ground state crossing, on a path that contains a level shifter cell.
  1801_LSH_NO_STRATEGY_LH/HL_PATH_NOLSH:Level shifter strategy is not specified for low-to-high power or high-to-low ground state crossing, on a path that does not contain any level shifter cell.
